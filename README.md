Project for Restaurant Kitchen Management System
We have Cookers, Dish, Dish Types and Ingredients of all dishes.
You can create, update, delete all objects, also you can search through every object's lists
by proper feature. All possible relations between all objects are also established. 
For example, you can display all ingredients the dish consists of, all dishes with the ingredient, and so on.
Besides, you can assign a cooker to be responsible for one or several dishes.

Below is the diagram of all models relations. You can also download this diagram pressing 'Download'
